Welcome to the Ripple wiki!
Ripple is a relational, stack-based dataflow language for exploring the Semantic Web and other multi-relational networks.
Ripple programs resemble path expressions as in [XPath](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/)
and postfix-style procedures as in
[Forth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_&#40;programming_language\&#41;).
Every program has an [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) representation,
so you can embed programs in the Web of Data as well as querying against it.
This implementation is written in Java and includes an interactive command-line interpreter as well as a query API which interoperates with [Sesame 2.0](http://openrdf.org/).
